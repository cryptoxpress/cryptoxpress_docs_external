# Overview

Two-factor Authentication is a way of verifying a userâ€™s identity by using a combination of two different verification methods. It adds an extra layer of security, thereby ensuring that only authorized user(s) can access an account, even if the password has been compromised.

In CryptoXpress, the two methods used for two-factor authentication are :

- **Username** and **Password** ( normal login credentials )
- **Biometric Authentication** or **4-digit Passcode**
- Authentication via **Authenticator App**

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication is already enabled for your CryptoXpress account. This means that you need to enter your login credentials and passcode whenever you sign in. To add an additional layer of security, you can also set up authentication via an authentication app. This is a quick and easy process:

1. Open the CryptoXpress App
2. Tap on the **More** Icon at the bottom right.

5. Now, You have enabled Two-factor Authentication using Authenticator.

Once you have set up authentication via an authentication app, you will need to enter a code from the app whenever you sign in to your CryptoXpress account. This will help to protect your account from unauthorized access.

You can also watch the video below for guide on how to setup Authenticator App.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

- Make sure that you keep your **authentication app** secure. Do not share the code with anyone.
- If you lose your phone or uninstall your **authentication app**, you can reset your **two-factor authentication** settings in the **CryptoXpress** app.
