      The CryptoXpress Application also offers a spot trading feature, allowing users to engage in immediate cryptocurrency exchanges at current market rates.

    <p>
      On the CryptoXpress platform, users are required to pay trading fees for every successful trade. These fees are denominated in the same asset that the user receives. For example, if a user buys a coin pair like BTC/USDT, the fees are paid in BTC when purchasing, and in USDT when selling. This ensures that fees are deducted in the corresponding cryptocurrency based on the nature of the trade.
