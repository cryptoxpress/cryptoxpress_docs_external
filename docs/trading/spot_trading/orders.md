### Market Orders: Seize the Opportunity Instantly!

A market order allows you to quickly buy or sell an asset at the prevailing market price, ensuring your order is executed instantly at the best available rate.


### Set Your Price, Set Your Pace: The Power of Limit Orders!

A limit order is a type of order you put on the order book with a specific price limit. It doesn't get executed right away, unlike a market order. Instead, the limit order will only be fulfilled when the market price matches or surpasses your specified limit price. This allows you to potentially purchase at a lower price or sell at a higher price compared to the current market rate. It gives you more control over your trades and allows you to set the price you're willing to buy or sell at.

### Stop-Limit Orders: Your Secret Weapon in Crypto Trading Precision!

A stop-limit order is a trading tool with two key prices: a stop price and a limit price. It allows you to specify your desired profit threshold or the maximum price you're willing to pay or lose in a trade. When the market reaches the trigger price, the order automatically converts into a limit order and is executed at or better than the limit price you've set. This way, you have control over your trade's outcomes.
