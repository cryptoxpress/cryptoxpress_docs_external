In the image above, you can see a snapshot of the **order book** for the BTC/USDT pair on CryptoXpress Futures Screen. Buy orders are color-coded in green and are displayed at specific price levels, while sell orders are shown in red.

Order books are a valuable tool for traders as they offer insights into the levels of **buyer** and **seller** interest at different prices. This information can be instrumental in identifying potential support and resistance levels in the market.

## Mastering Order Types: Your Blueprint for Precision in Crypto Trading!

When placing orders CyptoXpress provides several options to which types suits you best :

### Limit Order

A limit order is a type of order where you set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell an asset. This order will only go through if the market price reaches or surpasses the price you've defined. Essentially, limit orders enable you to try to buy at a lower price or sell at a higher price than what the asset is currently trading for.


### Market Order

A market order is a straightforward way to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at the current best available price. It gets matched with existing limit orders on the order book. When you use a market order, you'll incur fees as the one making the trade happen, often referred to as a "market taker."
