      At CryptoXpress, we determine user fees based on their trading activity. These fees typically come in two categories: <b>Maker</b> and <b>Taker</b> fees. <b>Makers</b> are users who contribute <b>liquidity</b> by adding orders to the order book, and, in recognition of their role, we offer them lower fees. On the other hand, <b>Takers</b> are users who place orders that execute <b>immediately</b>, essentially "taking" volume off the order book. These Taker trades incur a different fee structure.
