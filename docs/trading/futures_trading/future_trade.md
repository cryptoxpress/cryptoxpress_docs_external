      Futures trading in crypto involves the speculation on the future price of cryptocurrencies. In this type of trading, participants agree to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specified future date. It allows traders to profit from both rising and falling markets, as they can take long (buy) or short (sell) positions.
